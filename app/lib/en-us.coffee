        Museum records contain historical biodiversity data. Scientists and 
        researchers can use the data to conduct new research and make better 
        conservation decisions.

        We have thousands of specimen images, labels and ledgers from museum collections 
        and the biologists who maintain those collections. These contain information 
        about the where and when a species was found in the past. We need you to help 
        us transcribe that data and make it available for further use in biodiversity 
        and conservation research. Along the way, you will be possibly be finding 
        species that have never been observed anywhere else!
